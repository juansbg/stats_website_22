                            <p>Hi, my name is Juan and I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here to learn more about me. I was originally born in the United States, and lived there for many years before moving to <strong>Madrid, Spain</strong> to study high school and university.</p>
<p>In Madrid I did took two undergraduate degrees in electrical engineering and business analytics, and I also took some time to learn how to develop websites and apps as a hobby. In my spare time I love to read science fiction novels, play badminton, and even go skiing in the winter.</p>
<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
<p><img src="https://juansbg.netlify.app/about/skiing_trip.jpg" alt="&amp;ldquo;Skiing Trip to the Pyrenees&amp;rdquo;"></p>
<p>In the winter I love to spend my time with my family skiing in the Pyrenees in northern Spain, I have been going there since I was 10 years old and I have very fond memories there.</p>
<p>I also love to play badminton in my free time, I have been playing for 8 years in Spain, and I intend to keep playing during my time in London.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>My studies have allowed me to develop technical skills and abilities that will be useful throughout my career. These skills include the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand and explain data</li>
<li>Utilize software programs to analyze this data (R, Python, Tableau, Power BI)</li>
<li>Communicate my findings to those who may not be as familiar with the data</li>
<li>Work in a team environment and handle multiple projects at one time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been passionate about artificial intelligence. I remember being fascinated by the concept of creating a machine that could think and learn like a human. When I first heard about DALL-E, I was intrigued. DALL-E is an AI program that can create images from textual descriptions, and I was fascinated by its ability to understand and interpret human language. I believe that DALL-E has the ability to change the way we interact with computers, and I&rsquo;m excited to see what the future holds for this technology. The following image was created using this technology:</p>
