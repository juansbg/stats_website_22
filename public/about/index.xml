      <description>Hi, my name is Juan and I&amp;rsquo;m glad you&amp;rsquo;re here to learn more about me. I was originally born in the United States, and lived there for many years before moving to Madrid, Spain to study high school and university.
In Madrid I did took two undergraduate degrees in electrical engineering and business analytics, and I also took some time to learn how to develop websites and apps as a hobby.</description>
