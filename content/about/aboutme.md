# About me
Hi, my name is Juan and I'm glad you're here to learn more about me. I was originally born in the United States, and lived there for many years before moving to **Madrid, Spain** to study high school and university.

In Madrid I did took two undergraduate degrees in electrical engineering and business analytics, and I also took some time to learn how to develop websites and apps as a hobby. In my spare time I love to read science fiction novels, play badminton, and even go skiing in the winter.

## Hobbies
In the winter I love to spend my time with my family skiing in the Pyrenees in northern Spain, I have been going there since I was 10 years old and I have very fond memories there.

I also love to play badminton in my free time, I have been playing for 8 years in Spain, and I intend to keep playing during my time in London.

## Skills
My studies have allowed me to develop technical skills and abilities that will be useful throughout my career. These skills include the ability to: 

 - Understand and explain data
 - Utilize software programs to analyze this data (R, Python, Tableau, Power BI)
 - Communicate my findings to those who may not be as familiar with the data
 - Work in a team environment and handle multiple projects at one time

## Interests 
I've always been passionate about artificial intelligence. I remember being fascinated by the concept of creating a machine that could think and learn like a human. When I first heard about DALL-E, I was intrigued. DALL-E is an AI program that can create images from textual descriptions, and I was fascinated by its ability to understand and interpret human language. I believe that DALL-E has the ability to change the way we interact with computers, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for this technology. The following image was created using this technology:
